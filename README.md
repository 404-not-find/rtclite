The 39 Peers project aims to create an open source repository of light weight implementations 
of real-time communication (RTC) protocols. In a nutshell, it contains reference implementations, 
prototypes and sample applications, mostly written in Python, of various RTC standards defined in 
IETF, W3C and elsewhere, e.g., RFC 3261 (SIP), RFC 3550 (RTP), RFC 3920 (XMPP), WebRTC, RTMP, etc.

This is just the source code repository for the 39 Peers Project. Please visit the 
[project website](http://39peers.net) for further details.
